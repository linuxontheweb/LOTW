## Overview

### It's like Linux... on the web!

LOTW is all about porting the Linux/Unix (\*nix) text-based command and
configuration ethos into the modern web platform. The desktop environment is
minimal: the only visible UI element (other than the desktop) is the taskbar (where
minimized windows go).  It is essential that everything can be accomplished via
the keyboard (e.g. resizing windows and changing icon locations).

### Your files are locally stored

Everything that I've ever seen that called itself a "web-based operating
system" never seemed to have any real concept of *persistent client-side state*. With
LOTW, however, *persistent client-side state* is really the name of the game. For
example, performing the following simple operation in the terminal application
indeed creates an entry at `~/file.txt`, held in the browser's sandboxed local
storage, accessible regardless of network status.

	~$ echo "A bunch of interesting thoughts" > file.txt


# Disclaimer (YMMV)

LOTW is developed in [the crouton environment](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton),
which involves ChromeOS in developer mode.  All development and testing is currently done
on a Chromebook, using an up-to-date Chrome browser.

The system should basically work in any modern browser and host OS, but there are likely
many tiny glitches that degrade the user experience in other browsers and/or operating systems.

# Getting Started

First, clone this repo (duh)!

Then, start the site server with nodejs (uses the default port, 8080):

`$ node site.js`

Finally, in your browser, go to: http://localhost:8080


Or if you want to use another port (e.g. 12345), start it like so:

`$ node site.js 12345`

Then, go to: http://localhost:12345

# Desktop usage

## Taskbar

The visibility of the taskbar at the bottom of the screen can only be toggled
via the keyboard shortcut, **Toggle taskbar visibility** (shortcuts are shown
below). The taskbar simply exists as a placeholder for minimized windows. If
the taskbar is visible, then the windows held by it are kept in the window
stack, and can therefore be accessed by the **Cycle window stack** keyboard
shortcut. If the taskbar is not visible, the windows held by it are considered
to be in a "background" state, i.e., they are no longer in the window stack,
and cannot be accessed. In this case, the taskbar *must* be brought back into
view in order to regain access to minimized windows.

## Icon cursor

The manipulation of icons is one of the main reasons why computer users are
forced to take their hands off of the keyboard.  To give power users another
option, the LOTW desktop features a cursor that allows for the toggling of
selection status, opening, and moving of icons. With the **Move selected icons
to cursor** shortcut, icons on the desktop can be moved to different desktop
locations, and also between the desktop and folders (changing their paths in
the LOTW file system).


## Keyboard shortcuts

### General
- **Open terminal**: Alt+t
- **Invoke context menu**: Alt+c
- **Toggle taskbar visibility**: Ctrl+Alt+Shift+b
- **Toggle icon cursor visibility**: Ctrl+Alt+Shift+c

### Windows
- **Maximize window**: Alt+m
- **Minimize window**: Alt+n
- **Close window**: Alt+x
- **Fullscreen window**: Alt+f
- **Move window**: Shift+[arrow]
- **Resize window**: Ctrl+Shift+[arrow]
- **Toggle layout mode**: Ctrl+Shift+l
- **Toggle window chrome**: Ctrl+Shift+w
- **Cycle window stack**: Alt+\`

### Icons
- **Toggle icon selection status under cursor**: Space
- **Select/open icon under the cursor**: Enter
- **Open icon under cursor**: Alt+Enter
- **Continuously select icons under cursor**: Ctrl+arrow
- **Move selected icons to cursor**: Ctrl+m
- **Delete selected icons**: Ctrl+Backspace


# Command line usage

Other than high level control flow structures (like if..then and for..in), the syntax of
[the POSIX Shell Command Language](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html)
should mostly work. It is easiest to provide working examples that showcase the particular
capabilities of the LOTW system. Those are forthcoming.


# Development

## Project structure

[site.js](https://github.com/linuxontheweb/lotw/tree/main/site.js): The main nodejs service for sending core system files (in [root](https://github.com/linuxontheweb/lotw/tree/main/root)) to the client.

[bin](https://github.com/linuxontheweb/lotw/tree/main/bin): Folder where scripts related to the development and maintenance of the project are kept.

[docs](https://github.com/linuxontheweb/lotw/tree/main/docs): Folder where detailed instructions related to the usage of the system and the development and maintenance of the project are kept.

[root](https://github.com/linuxontheweb/lotw/tree/main/root): Folder where essential client-side files of the core system are kept.

[svcs](https://github.com/linuxontheweb/lotw/tree/main/svcs): Folder where any service that extends the system's core functionality (such as
sending and receiving email) are kept. Each service is to be run as an independent nodejs server
on an available port.

[www](https://github.com/linuxontheweb/lotw/tree/main/www): Folder where static assets to be used in the website (external to the LOTW system) and documentation are kept.

## Viewing and editing files

vim is the recommended text editor.

To see the folded rows in the source code, put these lines in your .vimrc:

	set foldmethod=marker
	set foldmarker=«,»
	set foldlevelstart=0

To quickly toggle row folds with the Enter key, add this line:

	nmap <enter> za

These are for easily inserting fold markers into the code file (from both normal and insert mode).

This inserts an open fold marker, invoked with Alt+o:

	execute "set <M-o>=\eo"
	nnoremap <M-o> a//«<esc>
	inoremap <M-o> //«

This inserts a close fold marker, invoked with Alt+c:

	execute "set <M-c>=\ec"
	nnoremap <M-c> a//»<esc>
	inoremap <M-c> //»

This inserts an open and close fold marker, with a space in between, invoked with Alt+f:

	execute "set <M-f>=\ef"
	nnoremap <M-f> a//«<enter><enter>//»<esc>
	inoremap <M-f> //«<enter><enter>//»
