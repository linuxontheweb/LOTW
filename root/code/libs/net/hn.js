/*Firebase - Querying Data//«


With Firebase database queries, you can selectively retrieve data based on
various factors. To construct a query in your database, you start by specifying
how you want your data to be ordered using one of the ordering functions:
orderByChild(), orderByKey(), or orderByValue(). You can then combine these
with five other methods to conduct complex queries: limitToFirst(),
limitToLast(), startAt(), endAt(), and equalTo().

Since all of us at Firebase think dinosaurs are pretty cool, we'll use a
snippet from a sample database of dinosaur facts to demonstrate how you can
query data in your Firebase database.:

{
	"lambeosaurus": {
		"height" : 2.1,
		"length" : 12.5,
		"weight": 5000
	},
	"stegosaurus": {
		"height" : 4,
		"length" : 9,
		"weight" : 2500
	}
}

You can order data in three ways: by child key, by key, or by value. A basic
database query starts with one of these ordering functions, each of which are
explained below.

Ordering by a specified child key

You can order nodes by a common child key by passing that key to
orderByChild(). For example, to read all dinosaurs ordered by height, you can
do the following:

//Code«

Node.js

var db = firebaseAdmin.database();
var ref = db.ref("dinosaurs");
ref.orderByChild("height").on("child_added", function(snapshot) {
  console.log(snapshot.key + " was " + snapshot.val().height + " meters tall");
});


Python
ref = db.reference('dinosaurs')
snapshot = ref.order_by_child('height').get()
for key, val in snapshot.items():
    print('{0} was {1} meters tall'.format(key, val))

//»

Any node which does not have the child key we're querying on is sorted with a
value of null, meaning it will come first in the ordering. For details on how
data is ordered, see the How Data is Ordered section.

Queries can also be ordered by deeply nested children, rather than only
children one level down. This is useful if you have deeply nested data like
this:

{
	"lambeosaurus": {
		"dimensions": {
			"height" : 2.1,
			"length" : 12.5,
			"weight": 5000
		}
	},
	"stegosaurus": {
		"dimensions": {
			"height" : 4,
			"length" : 9,
			"weight" : 2500
		}
	}
}

To query the height now, you can use the full path to the object rather than a
single key:

//Code«

Node.js
var ref = db.ref("dinosaurs");
ref.orderByChild("dimensions/height").on("child_added", function(snapshot) {
  console.log(snapshot.key + " was " + snapshot.val().height + " meters tall");
});

Python
ref = db.reference('dinosaurs')
snapshot = ref.order_by_child('dimensions/height').get()
for key, val in snapshot.items():
    print('{0} was {1} meters tall'.format(key, val))

//»

Queries can only order by one key at a time. Calling orderByChild() multiple
times on the same query throws an error.


****************************************

Using Indexes For Improved Performance

If you want to use orderByChild() on a production app, you should define the
keys you are indexing on via the .indexOn rule in your Security and Firebase
Rules. While you are allowed to create these queries ad-hoc on the client, you
will see greatly improved performance when using .indexOn. Read the
documentation on the .indexOn rule for more information.

****************************************


Ordering by key

You can also order nodes by their keys using the orderByKey() method. The
following example reads all dinosaurs in alphabetical order:

//Code«

Node.js
var ref = db.ref("dinosaurs");
ref.orderByKey().on("child_added", function(snapshot) {
  console.log(snapshot.key);
});

Python

ref = db.reference('dinosaurs')
snapshot = ref.order_by_key().get()
print(snapshot)

//»

Ordering by value

You can order nodes by the value of their child keys using the orderByValue()
method. Let's say the dinosaurs are having a dino sports competition and you're
keeping track of their scores in the following format:

{
	"scores": {
		"bruhathkayosaurus" : 55,
		"lambeosaurus" : 21,
		"linhenykus" : 80,
		"pterodactyl" : 93,
		"stegosaurus" : 5,
		"triceratops" : 22
	}
}


To sort the dinosaurs by their score, you could construct the following query:

//Code«

Node.js
var scoresRef = db.ref("scores");
scoresRef.orderByValue().on("value", function(snapshot) {
  snapshot.forEach(function(data) {
    console.log("The " + data.key + " dinosaur's score is " + data.val());
  });
});

Python
ref = db.reference('scores')
snapshot = ref.order_by_value().get()
for key, val in snapshot.items():
    print('The {0} dinosaur\'s score is {1}'.format(key, val))

//»

See the How Data is Ordered section for an explanation on how null, boolean,
string, and object values are sorted when using orderByValue().

Indexing on Values for Improved Performance

If you want to use orderByValue() in a production app, you should add .value to
your rules at the appropriate index. Read the documentation on the .indexOn
rule for more information.

Complex Queries

Now that it is clear how your data is ordered, you can use the limit or range
methods described below to construct more complex queries.

Limit Queries

The limitToFirst() and limitToLast() queries are used to set a maximum number
of children to be synced for a given callback. If you set a limit of 100, you
will initially only receive up to 100 child_added events. If you have fewer
than 100 messages stored in your database, a child_added event will fire for
each message. However, if you have over 100 messages, you will only receive a
child_added event for 100 of those messages. These are the first 100 ordered
messages if you are using limitToFirst() or the last 100 ordered messages if
you are using limitToLast(). As items change, you will receive child_added
events for items that enter the query and child_removed events for items that
leave it, so that the total number stays at 100.

Using the dinosaur facts database and orderByChild(), you can find the two heaviest dinosaurs:

//Code«

Node.js
var ref = db.ref("dinosaurs");
ref.orderByChild("weight").limitToLast(2).on("child_added", function(snapshot) {
  console.log(snapshot.key);
});

Python
ref = db.reference('dinosaurs')
snapshot = ref.order_by_child('weight').limit_to_last(2).get()
for key in snapshot:
    print(key)

//»

The child_added callback is triggered exactly two times, unless there are less
than two dinosaurs stored in the database. It will also get fired for every
new, heavier dinosaur that gets added to the database. In Python, the query
directly returns an OrderedDict containing the two heaviest dinosaurs.

Similarly, you can find the two shortest dinosaurs by using limitToFirst():

//Code«

Node.js
var ref = db.ref("dinosaurs");
ref.orderByChild("height").limitToFirst(2).on("child_added", function(snapshot) {
  console.log(snapshot.key);
});
Python
ref = db.reference('dinosaurs')
snapshot = ref.order_by_child('height').limit_to_first(2).get()
for key in snapshot:
    print(key)

//»

The child_added callback is triggered exactly two times, unless there are less
than two dinosaurs stored in the database. It will also get fired again if one
of the first two dinosaurs is removed from the database, as a new dinosaur will
now be the second shortest. In Python, the query directly returns an
OrderedDict containing the shortest dinosaurs.

You can also conduct limit queries with orderByValue(). If you want to create a
leaderboard with the top 3 highest scoring dino sports dinosaurs, you could do
the following:

//Code«

Node.js
var scoresRef = db.ref("scores");
scoresRef.orderByValue().limitToLast(3).on("value", function(snapshot) {
  snapshot.forEach(function(data) {
    console.log("The " + data.key + " dinosaur's score is " + data.val());
  });
});
Python
scores_ref = db.reference('scores')
snapshot = scores_ref.order_by_value().limit_to_last(3).get()
for key, val in snapshot.items():
    print('The {0} dinosaur\'s score is {1}'.format(key, val))

//»

Range Queries

Using startAt(), endAt(), and equalTo() allows you to choose arbitrary starting
and ending points for your queries. For example, if you wanted to find all
dinosaurs that are at least three meters tall, you can combine orderByChild()
and startAt():

//Code«

Node.js
  var ref = db.ref("dinosaurs");
  ref.orderByChild("height").startAt(3).on("child_added", function(snapshot) {
    console.log(snapshot.key);
  });
Python
ref = db.reference('dinosaurs')
snapshot = ref.order_by_child('height').start_at(3).get()
for key in snapshot:
    print(key)

//»

You can use endAt() to find all dinosaurs whose names come before Pterodactyl
lexicographically:

//Code«

Node.js
var ref = db.ref("dinosaurs");
ref.orderByKey().endAt("pterodactyl").on("child_added", function(snapshot) {
  console.log(snapshot.key);
});
Python
ref = db.reference('dinosaurs')
snapshot = ref.order_by_key().end_at('pterodactyl').get()
for key in snapshot:
    print(key)

//»

startAt() and endAt() are inclusive, meaning "pterodactyl" will match the query above.

You can combine startAt() and endAt() to limit both ends of your query. The
following example finds all dinosaurs whose name starts with the letter "b":

//Code«

Node.js
var ref = db.ref("dinosaurs");
ref.orderByKey().startAt("b").endAt("b\uf8ff").on("child_added", function(snapshot) {
  console.log(snapshot.key);
});

Python
ref = db.reference('dinosaurs')
snapshot = ref.order_by_key().start_at('b').end_at(u'b\uf8ff').get()
for key in snapshot:
    print(key)

//»

The \uf8ff character used in the query above is a very high code point in the
Unicode range. Because it is after most regular characters in Unicode, the
query matches all values that start with a b.

The equalTo() method allows you to filter based on exact matches. As is the
case with the other range queries, it will fire for each matching child node.
For example, you can use the following query to find all dinosaurs which are 25
meters tall:

//Code«

Node.js
var ref = db.ref("dinosaurs");
ref.orderByChild("height").equalTo(25).on("child_added", function(snapshot) {
  console.log(snapshot.key);
});
Python
ref = db.reference('dinosaurs')
snapshot = ref.order_by_child('height').equal_to(25).get()
for key in snapshot:
    print(key)

//»

Range queries are also useful when you need to paginate your data.

You can also combine orderByValue() with startAt() and endAt() to construct range queries.

Putting it all together

You can combine all of these techniques to create complex queries. For example,
you can find the name of the dinosaur that is just shorter than Stegosaurus:


//Code«

Node.js
var ref = db.ref("dinosaurs");
ref.child("stegosaurus").child("height").on("value", function(stegosaurusHeightSnapshot) {
  var favoriteDinoHeight = stegosaurusHeightSnapshot.val();

  var queryRef = ref.orderByChild("height").endAt(favoriteDinoHeight).limitToLast(2)
  queryRef.on("value", function(querySnapshot) {
    if (querySnapshot.numChildren() === 2) {
      // Data is ordered by increasing height, so we want the first entry
      querySnapshot.forEach(function(dinoSnapshot) {
        console.log("The dinosaur just shorter than the stegasaurus is " + dinoSnapshot.key);

        // Returning true means that we will only loop through the forEach() one time
        return true;
      });
    } else {
      console.log("The stegosaurus is the shortest dino");
    }
  });
});


Python
ref = db.reference('dinosaurs')
favotire_dino_height = ref.child('stegosaurus').child('height').get()
query = ref.order_by_child('height').end_at(favotire_dino_height).limit_to_last(2)
snapshot = query.get()
if len(snapshot) == 2:
    # Data is ordered by increasing height, so we want the first entry.
    # Second entry is stegosarus.
    for key in snapshot:
        print('The dinosaur just shorter than the stegosaurus is {0}'.format(key))
        return
else:
    print('The stegosaurus is the shortest dino')

How Data is Ordered

This section explains how your data is ordered when using each of the four
ordering functions.

orderByChild

When using orderByChild(), data that contains the specified child key is
ordered as follows:

Children with a null value for the specified child key come first.

Children with a value of false for the specified child key come next. If
multiple children have a value of false, they are sorted lexicographically by
key.

Children with a value of true for the specified child key come next. If
multiple children have a value of true, they are sorted lexicographically by
key.

Children with a numeric value come next, sorted in ascending order. If multiple
children have the same numerical value for the specified child node, they are
sorted by key.

Strings come after numbers, and are sorted lexicographically in ascending
order. If multiple children have the same value for the specified child node,
they are ordered lexicographically by key.

Objects come last, and sorted lexicographically by key in ascending order.

orderByKey

When using orderByKey() to sort your data, data is returned in ascending order
by key as follows. Keep in mind that keys can only be strings.

Children with a key that can be parsed as a 32-bit integer come first, sorted
in ascending order.

Children with a string value as their key come next, sorted lexicographically
in ascending order.

orderByValue

When using orderByValue(), children are ordered by their value. The ordering
criteria is the same as in orderByChild(), except the value of the node is used
instead of the value of a specified child key.
